# Wacky_Willy's_Funtime_Playland_Game
A simple text-based game created with python where the player must face an animatronic groundhog in order to survive the night at a children's playplace. 
Created as a final project for an introductory python class.

I created a map for this game originally so it was easier to get around but it's since been lost.
